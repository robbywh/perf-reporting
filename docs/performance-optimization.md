# Performance Optimization for Engineer Page Loading

## Issue Description

When clicking on engineer names in the top performers section, the page took a long time to load, causing poor user experience.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Heavy Database Queries**: Multiple expensive queries were executed synchronously
2. **Missing Database Indexes**: Lack of proper indexes on frequently queried columns
3. **Blocking Data Fetching**: All data was fetched before rendering any UI
4. **No Caching Strategy**: Queries weren't properly cached

## Solutions Implemented

### 1. Database Performance Optimization

**Added Strategic Indexes:**

- `TaskAssignee.engineerId` with `sprintId`
- `TaskAssignee.sprintId`
- `TaskTag.taskId` with `sprintId`
- `TaskTag.sprintId`
- `Task.sprintId`
- `Task.sprintId` with `statusId`

**Enhanced Query Caching:**

- Added proper cache strategies to expensive queries
- Implemented SWR caching with appropriate TTL values
- Added cache tags for better invalidation

### 2. Progressive Loading Architecture

**Before:**

```tsx
// All data fetched in parallel, blocking entire page
const allData = await fetchPageData(sprintIds, engineerId);
```

**After:**

```tsx
// Critical data first, then progressive loading
const { engineer, roleId } = await fetchCriticalData(sprintIds, engineerId);

// Each component loads independently
<Suspense fallback={<StatsCardsSkeleton />}>
  <AsyncStatsCards sprintIds={sprintIds} engineerId={engineerId} />
</Suspense>;
```

### 3. Optimized Component Architecture

**Split into Independent Async Components:**

- `AsyncStatsCards` - Loads statistics data
- `AsyncBarChart` - Loads chart data
- `AsyncPieDonutChart` - Loads task QA data
- `AsyncCodingHoursForm` - Loads sprint data
- `AsyncLeavePublicHoliday` - Loads leave data

**Benefits:**

- Faster initial page render
- Progressive content loading
- Better perceived performance
- Non-blocking user interface

### 4. Enhanced User Experience

**Improved Top Performers Component:**

- Better prefetching strategy
- Optimistic navigation
- Removed unnecessary Link wrapper for performance

## Performance Impact

### Expected Improvements:

1. **Initial Page Load**: 60-80% faster due to progressive loading
2. **Database Queries**: 40-60% faster with proper indexes
3. **Cache Hit Rate**: 70-90% for repeated data access
4. **User Experience**: Immediate visual feedback with loading states

### Monitoring Recommendations:

1. Monitor database query performance
2. Track cache hit rates
3. Measure time to first contentful paint
4. Monitor user interaction metrics

## Migration Applied

Database migration `20250629131720_add_performance_indexes` has been applied with the new indexes.

## Next Steps

1. **Monitor Performance**: Track the improvements in production
2. **Further Optimization**: Consider implementing React Query for client-side caching
3. **Database Optimization**: Monitor slow queries and add more indexes if needed
4. **User Feedback**: Collect user feedback on the improved experience

## Files Modified

1. `prisma/schema.prisma` - Added database indexes
2. `src/app/(root)/engineer/[engineerId]/page.tsx` - Implemented progressive loading
3. `src/components/top-performers/index.tsx` - Optimized navigation
4. `src/services/tasks/index.ts` - Enhanced query caching
5. `src/components/top-performers/loading-state.tsx` - Added loading states
