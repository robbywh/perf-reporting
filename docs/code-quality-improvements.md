# Code Quality Improvements

This document outlines the changes made to improve code quality and reduce duplication in the project.

## 1. New Utility Files

### Common Types (`/src/types/common.ts`)

- Created shared interfaces for sprint data, options, and task details
- Defined constants for file uploads and validation

### Async Component Utilities (`/src/lib/utils/async-components.tsx`)

- Created `withSuspense` HOC to standardize Suspense usage
- Added factory function to generate async components with consistent patterns
- Defined common interfaces for sprint and engineer components

### Image Upload Utility (`/src/lib/utils/image-upload.tsx`)

- Custom hook for handling image uploads with validation
- Centralized file size and type validation
- Progress tracking for uploads

### Chart Colors Utility (`/src/lib/utils/chart-colors.ts`)

- Standardized chart colors across the application
- Functions to generate dynamic colors and lighter variants
- Removed duplicated color generation logic

## 2. New UI Components

### Image Viewer (`/src/components/ui/image-viewer.tsx`)

- Reusable component for displaying images with zoom functionality
- Standardized loading states and placeholder texts
- Edit button option for authorized users

## 3. Refactored Components

### Coding Hours Form (`/src/components/coding-hours-form/index.tsx`)

- Simplified by using the new ImageViewer component
- Improved prop types and structure
- Better error handling and validation

### Line Chart SP Coding (`/src/components/charts/line-chart-sp-coding/index.tsx`)

- Updated to use standardized chart colors
- Removed duplicated color generation logic

## 4. Benefits

- **Reduced Duplication**: Common patterns extracted to reusable utilities
- **Improved Maintainability**: Centralized logic for common tasks
- **Better Type Safety**: Standardized interfaces for component props
- **Enhanced User Experience**: Consistent UI patterns across the application
- **Easier Testing**: Isolated utility functions are easier to test
- **Simplified Components**: Components now focus on their core responsibilities

## 5. Future Recommendations

- Apply similar patterns to other components
- Consider creating a design system for common UI elements
- Add unit tests for utility functions
- Create documentation for the new utilities and patterns
